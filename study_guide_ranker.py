# ~ What to study next? PY109 study guide difficulty ranker ~

# Since we should compare any particular topic against others at least ~3 times
# to have meaningful output, the comparison pairs are totally randomized.
# So maybe you'll see a topic 4 times before you see
# some other topic at all, but I think that's ok here...

# A pair of two topics that have been compared
# will not be compared again against one another.

# I thought about lightly editing the study guide
# for this program, but left it as is, for familiarity.

# It would've been nice to do a single key press, without enter, but that's not PY101-109 stuff.
